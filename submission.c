Tell us about a recent skill you have developed either on or off work, and how you approached the process.\nJoined the 42KL to learn coding as it is the skill of the 21st century, I am keenly interested in the development of digital cryptography; as the use in database security, monetary and information transactions continue to be mainstream. New to peer to peer learning, I mingle with the fellow students, brainstormed and learned coding from each other. Most of the other time were spent scouring the net for solutions and for understanding about the basic language of C. That is a start, now I've learned to code; and more importantly learned to learn to code. Hence, Solidity, web3.js here I come!\n\n");
